<h1 align="center">Static Testing Basics</h1>


### Learning Objective 3.1.1 (K1) Recognize types of products that can be examined by the different static test techniques

**Static Testing**: *Is the reviewing of work products in order to find defects and gain understanding of what was required*

**Conducted in three ways (*Techniques*)**:
- **Manual** - Reviews *(Informal, Walkthroughs, Technical, and Inspections)*
- **Static Analysis** - *Developer tools that reads (does not execute code) source code*
- **Checklist** - *Use predefined list of common defects to systematically check documents or code*

**Types of products that can be examined by different Static Testing techniques**:

(1.) *Requirements*

(2.) *Epics/User Stories/Acceptance Criteria*

(3.) *Design specifications*

(4.) *Source Code*

(5.) *Config Setups*

(6.) *Testware*

(7.) *User Guides*

(8.) *Web Pages*

(9.) *Contracts, Management Documents, Budget, Plans*

(10.) *Models - (Activity Diagrams)*

### Learning Objective 3.1.2 (K2) Explain the value of Static Testing

(1.) *Finds defects early = Cheaper to fix*

(2.) *Prevents defects moving through SDLC*

(3.) *Evaluates the quality of the work product*

(4.) *Reduces development timescale & cost*

(5.) *Clears Assumptions and Confirms "meaning"*

(6.) *Improving team/stakeholder communication/shared understanding*

(7.) *Increases development productivity (get it right the first time)*

(8.) *Finds defects that dynamic testing cannot*

(9.) *Involves wide variety of stakeholders = Different perspectives*

(10.) *Code defects found cheaper by Static Analysis*

### Learning Objective 3.1.3 (K2) Compare and Contrast Static testing & Dynamic Testing


| **Static Testing**                         | **Dynamic Testing**                       |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| *No code executions*                       | *Code execution*                          |
| *Finds defects that Dynamic testing won't* | *Finds defects that Static testing won't* |
| *No Test Cases required*                   | *Requires Test cases*                     |
| *Manual (Reviews), Automated (Static Analysis)* | *Manual or Automated*                |
| *Finds Defects*                            | *Finds defects (analysis of failures)*    |
| *Measure Quality Characteristics*          | *Measure Quality Characteristics*         |
| *Best before Dynamic testing*              | *Supplements Static testing*              |
| *Finds defect on path code*                | *Generates Failures*                      |
| *Early Testing*                            |                                           |

<h1 align="center">Feedback and Review Process</h1>

### Learning Objective 3.2.1 (K1) Identify the benefits of early and frequent stakeholder feedback

(1.) *Communicates quality problems*

(2.) *Ensures the work product meets stakeholder expectations = stakeholder satisfaction achieved*

(3.) *Frequent communications with stakeholders ensures that their needs are understood*

(4.) *Drives focus to features that are of most value to stakeholder*

(5.) **Prevents**:
- *Blame game*
- *Missed Deadlines*
- *Project Failure*
- *Rework*
---
### Learning Objective 3.2.2 (K2) Summaries the activities of the review processes

(1.) **Planning**
- *Scope of the review*
- *Objectives of the review*
- *Work product to be reviewed*
- *Quality characteristics to be evaluated*
- *Timeframes are defined*

(2.) **Initiation**
- *Ensuring that everyone that is involved has the required work product and is prepared*

(3.) **Individual Review**
- *Reviewers perform individual reviews to identify anomalies, make recommendations, and draft questions*

(4.) **Communication & Analysis**
- *This is where anomalies are discussed and decisions are concluded*

(5.) **Fixing & Reporting**
- *Defects are corrected and reports are done*

---

### Learning Objective 3.2.3 (K1) Recall the responsibilities assigned to the principal roles when performing reviews

(1.) **Manager** - *Decides what need to be reviewed and provides the resources*

(2.) **Author** - *Creates and fixes the work product under review*

(3.) **Moderator/Facilitator** - *Ensures the effective running of meetings*

(4.) **Scribe** - *Collect anomalies from reviewers and record review decisions*

(5.) **Reviewer** - *Performs reviews*

(6.) **Review Leader** - *Decides who will be involved, and how the review will take place*

---

### Learning Objective 3.2.4 (K2) Compare and Contrast the different review types

(1.) **Informal Review**
- *Don't follow defined process*
- *Don't require formal documentation output*
- *Objective is to identify anomalies*

(2.) **Walkthrough**
- *Led by the Author*
- *Small group*
- *Author prepares*
- *Scribe mandatory*
- *Vary in formality*
- *Good for Dry-Runs*

(3.) **Technical Review**
- *Performed by Technically qualified Reviewer*
- *Led by Trained Moderator*
- *Scribe mandatory*
- *Defects logged*
- *Individual Preparation*


(4.) **Inspection**
- *Most Formal*
- *Follows generic process*
- *Individual preparation*
- *Defined Roles (Reviewers)*
- *Entry & Exit Criteria*
- *Checklists, Rules, Source*
- *Documented work product*
- *Trained Moderator (not Author)*
- *Recording / Metrics*
- *Defects logged*
- *Scribe mandatory*

- **Clear objectives (Review Planning â€“ set Exit Criteria)**

- **Correct Technique Applied**

- **Checklists Current**

- **Chunking of large docs**

- **Adequate time to prepare Reviews scheduled and enough notice**

- **Management support**

- **Integrated into Quality / Test Policy**

- **Right People**

- **Testers viewed as valuable**

- **Enough time to review and attention to detail**

- **Well managed / facilitated process**

- **Atmosphere of trust**

- **Body language**

- **Training provided**

- **Culture of learning & process improvement**

- **Defects taken seriously**
