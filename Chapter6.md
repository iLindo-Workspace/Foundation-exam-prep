### Learning Objective 6.1.1 (K2) Explain how different types of test tools supports Testing

(1.) **Management Tools** - *Facilitates the management of SDLC, Requirements, Test, Defects, and Configurations*

(2.) **Static Analysis Tools** - *Support reviews and static analysis*

(3.) **Test Design & Implementation Tool** - *Assist in generating test cases, test data, and test procedures*

(4.) **Test Execution & Coverage Tools** - *Enable automated test execution and coverage measurements*

(5.) **Non-Functional Testing Tools** - *Perform non-functional testing, which is difficult or impossible to conduct manually*

(6.) **Collaboration Tools** - *Facilitates communication among team members*

(7.) **Scalability and Deployment Tools** - *Virtual machines and containerization solutions for efficient deployment*

### Learning Objective 6.1. (K2) Recall the benefits and risks of Test Automation

**Benefits**

(1.) **Time Saved** - *By reducing repetitive manual work*

(2.) **Prevent human errors** - *Through consistency and repeatability*

(3.) **Providing measures** - *That are too far for humans to derive*

(4.) **Easier access to testing information** 

(5.) **Reduced execution time** - *Leading to earlier defect detection, faster feedback, and quicker time to market*

(6.) **More time for testers to focus on designing deeper, more effective tests**


**Risks**

(1.) **Unrealistic Expectations** *about the benefits of the tool*

(2.) **Inaccurate** *estimations of time, cost, effort...**

(3.) **Inappropriate use** - *Using test tool when manual testing is more effective*

(4.) **Over dependency** - *Ignoring the need for human critical thinking*

(5.) **Dependency on the tool Vendor**

(6.) **Open-Source** - *Using an open-source software which  may be abandoned*

(7.) **Incompatibility with other platforms** 

(8.) **Compliance with Regulations/Standards** - *May not comply to Reg/Sds*
